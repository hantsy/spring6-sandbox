# Spring 6 Sandbox

Spring 6 (and Spring Boot 3) upgrades to use Jakarta EE 9+ and Java 17 as the new code baseline. Aligned with competitors such as [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) and [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/), Spring 6 adds built-in native build support, which was previously [an experimental project](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-native/releases/tag/0.11.0). Additionally, many long-deprecated features have been removed in Spring 6.0.
